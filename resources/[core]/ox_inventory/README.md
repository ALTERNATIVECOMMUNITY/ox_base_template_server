## Framework support
There are plans to setup more generic events so the inventory can be used without any framework dependency, or easily ported to your framework. For the time being, our _[fork of ESX Legacy](https://github.com/overextended/es_extended/)_ has integrated support. We are working on converting some common ESX resources to showcase how easy it can be to achieve integration.
